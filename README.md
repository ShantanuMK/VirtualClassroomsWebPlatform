# VirtualClassroomsWebPlatform

This is a complete Virtual classroom web Application with a video conferencing Service.
For video conferencing Service, I've used Jitsi Meet API which was self-hosted.
For setting up jitsi meet on a self-hosted server, you can follow the steps here
https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/intro in Self-Hosting section. and this video is really helpful (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQRwtUamHQU).
You just need to replace the hosting web address with yours in the meet api section on the web page.
The best part of this app is that Meeting rooms are automatically generated as per the predefined school-id and the class-id of the student. So the teacher does not need to send the meeting link to students each time. The teacher can just directly start the lecture by clicking on the subject school has allocated to her and the students can directly join the lecture by clicking on the subjects the school has assigned to them. (this really saves a lot of time)

Three Actors:
Student, Teacher, School

features of school:
-add/remove teachers and students to their school in web application
-add/remove subjects to particular class & division
-assign subjects to teacher
-generate & view students report
-etc

features of teacher

-etc

features of student

I'll soon be adding details of the database design.
